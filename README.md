# fftw - EPICS Device Support for the FFTW Library

C++ [EPICS](https://epics-controls.org) Device Support module wrapping around
the [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/) library v3.

The Device Support uses C++ shared pointers and the feature to swap the BPTR
of EPICS array records to minimize copying of arrays. 

## Status

One of the DFT algorithm variants provided by the FFTW library is supported:
One-dimensional, real input data transformed from the time domain (sampled data)
to the frequency domain (amplitude/phase).

The module can be extended to support other variants.

## Prerequisites

*   A C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard. \
    Microsoft Visual C++ needs to be from Visual Studio 2015 or newer.
    g++ needs to be 4.6 or above.

*   [EPICS Base](https://epics-controls.org/resources-and-support/base/)
    release 3.15 (and up; EPICS 7 is supported).

*   The [pyepics module](https://pyepics.github.io/pyepics) for running
    the tests.

*   The [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/) library (v3).

## Building the module

This is a standard EPICS module.

Inside the `configure` subdirectory or one level above the TOP location
(TOP is where this README file resides), create a file `RELEASE.local`
that sets `EPICS_BASE` to the absolute path inside your EPICS
installation.

Configure the compiler on Linux to use the C++11 standard by adding
```makefile
USR_CXXFLAGS_Linux += -std=c++11
```
to the `CONFIG_SITE` file (or one of the host/target specific site
configuration files). \
It is preferable to set this option globally in EPICS Base.

## Using the module

IOC applications that use the module need to

*   add an entry to the Device Support module in their `RELEASE.local` file
*   include `fftw.dbd` when building the IOC's DBD file
*   include `fftwSup` in the support libraries for the IOC binary.
